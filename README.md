### A little bit about us

**Linda**:gemini:

I am from Latvia, Riga. I have 2 daughters and at the moment I'm trying to balance starting my youngest daughter's kindergarten, family, work, and the WoTech course + somewhere in between I still need to find time for rest üòÑ  I have no previous experience in programming and I feel that this course is challenging, but I'm optimistic about the end result. Of the two programming languages, I like Python :snake: more than Java.

Interest about IT started when I was on my second child's maternity leave - after I finished Riga TechGirls course Discover Tech in november of 2023. I started to think that it is time for something new and maybe to change my career to IT.




**Marilyn**‚ôè

I am from Tallinn, Estonia. Daily I am working as specialist in a university but during my leasure time I love to read, do sports and go to my cottage house. 
Previously I have had no experience in IT but for some reason I have always been interested in learning it. So when I randomly saw the ad for this course, I took it as a sign and submitted my application. And here we are :). 
However, witout prior experience it has been hard to follow along and due to due intensive study mode, I struggle with finding time for practicing coding on days when we do not have lectures. But still I somehow really like it and hopefully some day I will the "ahaa"-moment aka after long period of confusion, suddenly everthing makes sense. 
In terms of programme language - I still prefer Python over Java, but slowly the latter has started to grow on me. 


**Astrid**:taurus:

I live in Tartu, Estonia. I have learned Html/CSS and SQL but that was few years ago. Right now I'm interested in learning more and more about IT because I don't want to stay in comfort zone.

I also like video games and am currently playing Ghost of Tsushima :video_game:
